# Upgrade Contract Overview

## Document Purpose
This document serves as a study note focused on the overview of upgradeable contracts in Solidity. The content is structured to be reader-friendly and engineer-focused, with explanations, relevant code examples, and detailed comments. This document is intended for record-keeping and to aid engineers in understanding various upgradeable contract patterns.

## Introduction to Upgradeable Contracts

Upgradeable contracts allow developers to modify the logic of a deployed smart contract without altering its storage or requiring a redeployment. This approach is useful for implementing new features, patching bugs, or adapting to evolving requirements while retaining data continuity.

### Why Use Upgradeable Contracts?

In a typical smart contract, once deployed, the code cannot be changed. This immutability ensures reliability but limits flexibility. Upgradeable contracts solve this limitation by:
- Allowing code logic upgrades while maintaining the same contract address.
- Preserving storage data, enabling a seamless transition across different versions of the contract.

---

## Key Concepts of Upgradeable Contracts

1. **Proxy Contracts**:
   - Proxy contracts delegate calls to an implementation (logic) contract.
   - They serve as a "front" for the actual logic, holding storage and acting as a stable reference point for users.

2. **Implementation Contracts**:
   - Contain the business logic for the smart contract.
   - Can be upgraded independently, with the proxy redirecting calls to new implementations as needed.

3. **Storage Layout Consistency**:
   - Since the proxy maintains storage, the order and structure of variables in the implementation contract must remain consistent across upgrades to avoid data corruption.

4. **Delegatecall**:
   - A Solidity function used by proxies to execute logic from the implementation contract while maintaining its own storage.

## Upgradeable Contract Patterns

There are three primary patterns for creating upgradeable contracts:

1. **Transparent Proxy Pattern**
   - Separates user and admin roles, with the admin handling upgrades.
   - The user interacts with the proxy as if it were the implementation contract.
   - Example: OpenZeppelinâ€™s `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`.

2. **UUPS Proxy Pattern (EIP-1822)**
   - The implementation contract manages its own upgradeability via a defined `upgradeTo` function.
   - Provides a simpler and cheaper proxy by embedding upgrade logic within the implementation contract itself.

3. **Beacon Proxy Pattern**
   - A beacon contract controls the implementation for multiple proxies.
   - Multiple proxy instances reference the same beacon, allowing synchronized upgrades across all instances.

## Code Examples

### Transparent Proxy Pattern
#### Proxy Contract
```solidity
// TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TransparentUpgradeableProxy {
    address public admin;
    address public implementation;

    constructor(address _implementation, address _admin) {
        admin = _admin;
        implementation = _implementation;
    }

    function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) public {
        require(msg.sender == admin, "Only admin can upgrade");
        implementation = newImplementation;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        address impl = implementation;
        require(impl != address(0), "Implementation not set");

        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), impl, ptr, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            let size := returndatasize()
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)

            switch result
            case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }
            default { return(ptr, size) }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Implementation Contract (V1)
```solidity
// MyImplementationV1.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MyImplementationV1 {
    uint256 public count;

    function initialize(uint256 _count) public {
        count = _count;
    }

    function increment() public {
        count += 1;
    }
}
```
